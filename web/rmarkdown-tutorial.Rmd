```{r setup,include=FALSE}
# this works best if this chunk is run manually first, but should work generally as well.
source(file.path(rprojroot::find_root(rprojroot::has_file("pathconfig.R")),"pathconfig.R"),echo=TRUE)
source(file.path(programs,"config.R"), echo=FALSE)
local.libraries <- c("latex2exp","venneuler")

results <- sapply(as.list(local.libraries), pkgTest)

```

## Introduction

This is meant as a really quick overview of RMarkdown, and "dynamic documents" in general.

- For more Rmarkdown tutorials, see [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
- For an alternate "notebook" style document, see [this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) and the next session by Ivan
- if you want to stick to Stata only, see [Stata dyndoc](https://www.stata.com/features/overview/markdown/)
- Other uses: SAS, ArcGIS Pro, etc. - variants of the Jupyter notebook implementation

Once I've talked about the how, I will conclude with some comments on "why" and "when". Bear with me.

## Boilerplate

The following sections are what you get when you create a blank RMarkdown document.

## But first

What are the requirements? 

- Rstudio
- R

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

````
  ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
  plot(pressure)
  ```
````

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## From the introduction earlier

I had a few graphs in the introduction earlier:

### Scalability


Processing times for perfectly (or "embarassingly") parallelizable problems scale linearly: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(latex2exp)
p <- ggplot(data =data.frame(x=0), mapping = aes(x=x))
fun.1 <- function(x) x*1.1
fun.2 <- function(x) x^2
fun.3 <- function(x) x*sqrt(x)

p <- p + stat_function(
          fun = fun.1,
          mapping = aes(color = "fun.1")
          ) +
    scale_color_manual(name = "Functions",
                       values = c("blue", "red", "purple"), # Color specification
                       labels = unname(TeX(c("X","$X^2$","$X*\\sqrt(X)$"))))
p +     scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) 

```

However, some problems scale quadratically:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- p +   stat_function(
          fun = fun.2,
          mapping = aes(color = "fun.2")
          ) 
p +     scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) 
```

So the trick is to find solutions that scale with less than quadratic increases, such as $X\sqrt(X)$:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- p +
    stat_function(
          fun = fun.3,
          mapping = aes(color = "fun.3")
          ) 
p +     scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) 
```

The reason is obvious when you let this run for large numbers (precisely where this becomes salient):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p +     scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000)) 
```


## End of example

- So why use this in general? 
- And what if I won't be using R because ... ?


## Using Rmarkdown with Stata

- An example
- Key element: defining the Stata "engine"

```
stataexe <- "C:/Program Files/Stata16/StataSE-64.exe"
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(stata=stataexe))
```

```{r setup_stata}
stataexe <- "C:/Program Files/Stata16/StataSE-64.exe"
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(stata=stataexe))
```
and then marking code chunks as executable by Stata:

````

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}`r ''`
sysuse auto
summarize
```
````
which runs Stata in the background as

```
running: C:/Program Files/Stata16/StataSE-64.exe  /q /e do
"C:\path\to\code\stata4c7c7b5a7791.do"
```
which then yields in the text:

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}
sysuse auto
summarize
```

- more details, see [StataMarkdown tutorial](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/Stataworkshops/Stata%20and%20R%20Markdown/StataMarkdown.html) ([local version](../external/StataMarkdown.html))

## The use of "engines"

Engines (or kernels, in Jupyter notation) are at the core of dynamic documents. They define how you can run things. Thus, if you can define a way to run a piece of software programmatically - from the command line! - you can run it from some dynamic document.

## That command line again

A recurring feature of many of these tools are the ability to run code from the command line.

- notice that we did not use the GUI to Stata!
- the command line would have been different on MacOS or on Linux
- the Linux version would have worked on BioHPC as well!

## When should you use Dynamic Documents?

- Should you write your next term paper or article in Rmarkdown?
- Should you write your instructions on how to run code in Rmarkdown?
- Should you inline all code, or write code externally?

What does that last piece mean? Inline code is written directly into the Rmarkdown, and has to be run (mostly) by running the Rmd file:

````
  ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
  plot(pressure)
  ```
````

Externalizing the code into a file would mean

````
  ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
  source("pressure.R", echo =TRUE)
  ```
````
where the file `pressure.R` had contents:
```
  plot(pressure)
```

What's the difference?

You can execute `pressure.R` 

- by calling R directly (`Rscript pressure.R`)
- by calling it from the Rmd file (see above)
- by calling it from Stata! (using an external call to R) 
- or any other combination
