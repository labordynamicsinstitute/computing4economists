Why parallel processing?
=======================
incremental: true
![diminishing Increase in CPU power](../documents/cpu-power.png)
***
Single-core performance growth has slowed. More cost-effective to add multiple cores.

Threads vs processes
====================

Both can be used for parallel processing
* A process can launch multiple threads
  * Threads run only on the same node
  * Threads run within a process and have access to the memory and resources of that process
* A user or program can launch multiple processes (same or different node) and communicate via IPC or MPI
* Different tools for working with threads and processes, although the goal is the same

Parallel execution
==================
![spawn-compute-gather](../documents/spawn-compute-gather.png)
***
... or "map-reduce"...

Benefits vs costs
===============
incremental: true
Using cores can potentially do more work
***
But
* Each core needs access to the data (spawn)
* Each core needs to output results (gather)
* Additional programming and processing time required to implement solution in parallel

Dependencies
============
* Can you break the entire compute problem into independent chunks
  * Yes - potential candidate for parallel execution
  * No - not all of it
    * Identify the portions of the code that do not have dependencies
* The benefits of parallelization depend directly on the time spent executing parallel code

Amdahl's law
=============
![Amdahls law](../documents/amdahls.png)

***
$$ \lim_{P \to \inf} \frac{1}{\frac{1-\alpha}{P} + \alpha} = \frac{1}{\alpha} $$

* P = Number of cores
* $\alpha$ = proportion of time spent in parallel
* Diminishing returns to increasing P for a problem of fixed size

Example problem
===============
Calculate the column means of a data matrix
* Divide data into equal groups (blocks) of rows for parallel processing (spawn)
  * Is the array in memory or does it need to be read from disk?
  * Memory access is an order of magnitude faster than disk access
  * ... but has more limits
* Within each group, calculate the sum of each column
  * Store result (what if one core wants to write the result at the same time as another core?)
* Sum the results for each group and divide the total sample size

Example (continued)
===================
* Or: process only a single column at a time (column-store databases!)
* In general, if the groups are
  * large
  * numerous
  * amount of processing time for each group is high
* then it is worthwhile to execute in parallel

Considerations
==============
Both programming time and processing time should be considered when deciding on structure of program
* Carefule tuning of single-threaded application may be a better investment
* Does your program take days or weeks to find a solution?
* How often do you expect to run the code?
Before implementing a parallel solution, spend time assessing the expected benefit

Implicit vs Explicit
===================
Not necessarily a custom solution - switching software may also be worthwhile
* SAS, Stata, Matlab have internal parallel algorithms that will do much if not all of the hard work for you
  * they will spawn the threads and gather the results using well-tested routines
  * Your job is to manage the number of threads
* Programs assume all threads on a core are available to you (or limited by license)
  * On a large node, not always efficient
  * On a shared system, not allowed!

Taking control of implicit threads
==================================
* SAS
  * `THREADS` and `CPUCOUNT=X`
  * `NOTHREADS`
* Stata
  * `set processors X`
* Matlab
  * `-singleCompThread` (may not be exact)

Explicit processes: PBS-like
==================
PBS-like systems allow you spawn jobs automatically
* `qsub -t 1-100%5 script.qsub` runs 5 jobs at a time, from 1-100
* `$PBS_ARRAYID` is provided to the script, and can be used to pass to the program, for instance
  * SAS

```
%let sample=%sysget(PBS_ARRAYID);
data one;
  set LIBRARY.bigdata(where=(mod(_n_,100)=&sample.));
  run;
```
  * Similar in R, Matlab, Stata

Explicit processes: PBS-like, Stata
==================
```
local arrayid : env PBS_ARRAYID
use if sample == `arrayid' \\
   using ${LIBRARY}/bigdata
```
would read in only the records for which the (previously created) variable `sample` is equal to the PBS_ARRAYID.

Explicit processes
==================
Conditional execution
```
JOB_ID_1=$(qsub 01_script.sh)
JOB_ID_2=$(qsub -W depend=afterok:$JOB_ID_1 02_script.sh)
JOB_ID_3=$(qsub -W depend=afterok:$JOB_ID_2 03_script.sh)
```

Parallel processing

```

===================

> cl <- makeCluster(ncpus)

> registerDoParallel(cl)

> x <- iris[which(iris[, 5] != "setosa"), c(1, 5)]

> ptime <- system.time({
