Goal
========================================================
The goal of this workshop is to make early-career researchers in the social sciences (e.g. Ph.D. students and early faculty) aware of computational tools and toolkits that will allow them to more efficiently and reproducibly conduct their research. We will showcase computer-oriented techniques and tools, from basic command line tools on Windows, Linux, and Mac, to version control, to optimization and parallelization techniques. These methods are useful not just for high-performance computing, but by necessity make research reproducible. If you touch a computer as part of your research, you should come!

This workshop is designed to open your eyes to the possibilities, scratching
the surface, but mostly not diving into any particular depths. The goal is NOT to teach a full
course on SAS, Stata, Matlab, R, Python, MPI, Fortran, etc. - there are other classes for that. We will teach just enough of each programming language to
be able to highlight additional techniques. There will be hands-on training on a few systems (TBD).

===

We highlight that this is a workshop - we will work on problems as a group, drawing on expertise in the "room" as needed. If you have a specific question, and want to work on it, we may do so. If you want to primarily listen, that's fine too.

Some parts of the workshop will be asynchronous (pre-recorded), but a significant portion will be live. You should expect to do some exercises each day.

Target group
------------
Second year Ph.D. and higher, and faculty, in Economics or other social sciences. If you haven't taken the course in the past, or want a refresher, you should participate

Requirements
-------------
* Working knowledge of at least one statistical programming language (R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, Gauss) - the specific languange is not important.
* An interest in computational social science

Setup
========================================================
* [Register](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8dc16keYOMEc3Xw) 
* (optional) Request an account on Econ Cluster on the [BioHPC account request page](https://biohpc.cornell.edu/NewUserRequest.aspx) (add to Comment "Econ Grad Student")
* Various software will be installed as part of the class, as part of a standard toolkit.


Tentative Agenda - Prior to Day 1
=================================
* [Installation checklist](setup-checklist.md) - useful software to have
* Watch Lars' [talk on replicability and reproducibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLoeNzOApFk)
* Learn about the [command line](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/computing4economists/blob/master/Git_CL_Slides/intro_command_line.md) ([lecture notes](../Git_CL_Slides/Slides_CommandLine.pdf)), version control (links coming)

Tentative Agenda - Day 1
================


- Intro, why we do this, why we need this (it's not just high-performance computing)
- Command line (+ hands-on)
- Version control (hands-on)
- Text editors and software-agnostic development environments (Visual Studio Code, Rstudio, Jupyter) (+ hands-on)
- Reproducible report with Markdown, Stata, and R
- A reproducible report with Jupyter and Julia (*Ivan Rudik*) 

Tentative Agenda - Day 2
================

- Computational tools at Cornell, elsewhere
- Introduction to parallel processing
- Hands-on parallel (R, Julia, Stata) (*Ivan Rudik*) 
- Docker/ containers: how to create portable reproducible code (Lars) (hands-on)

Tentative Agenda - Day 3
================

(partially joint with LDI Replicator training)

- Data provenance and citations: what is it, why, how
