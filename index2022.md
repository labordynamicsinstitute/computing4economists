Goal
========================================================

The goal of this workshop is to make early-career researchers in the social sciences (e.g. Ph.D. students and early faculty) aware of computational tools and toolkits that will allow them to more efficiently and reproducibly conduct their research. We will showcase computer-oriented techniques and tools, from basic command line tools on Windows, Linux, and Mac, to version control, to optimization and parallelization techniques. These methods are useful not just for high-performance computing, but by necessity make research reproducible. If you touch a computer as part of your research, you should come!

More goals and non-goals
===

This workshop is designed to open your eyes to the possibilities, scratching
the surface, but mostly not diving into any particular depths. The goal is NOT to teach a full
course on SAS, Stata, Matlab, R, Python, MPI, Fortran, etc. - there are other classes for that. We will teach just enough of each programming language to
be able to highlight additional techniques. There will be hands-on training on a few systems (TBD). 

We will discuss ways to structure your computional projects with an eye on efficiency during development and reproducibility after publication (by AEA standards). Additional topics include reproducibility when data may be private, computation when compute resources are scarce (parallel computing, cloud computing), automation in the service of reliability and reproducibility, and other topics. We will provide hands-on training in at least one advanced computing technique.


You and the workshop
===

We highlight that this is a **workshop** - we will work on problems as a group, drawing on expertise in the "room" as needed. If you have a specific question, and want to work on it, we may do so. If you want to primarily listen, that's fine too. You should expect to do some exercises each day. We have a two-day break (to not step on the Economics Department's TA training), and reconvene on the Friday (Aug 19) to discuss outcomes, questions, and next steps for some.

Target group
------------
Second year Ph.D. and higher, and faculty, in Economics or other social sciences. If you haven't participated in the workshop in the past, or want a refresher, you should participate! If you want to chat about the computational aspects of social sciences, or reproducibility, come and join the workshop!


Tentative schedule
------------------

> Subject to change based on participant input! See [here](web/index.html) for the [2021 agenda and links](web/index.html).

### Day 1

- Why you should learn (and love) the command line
    - Framework: [Carpentries' "The Unix Shell"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- Git, Version control
- Data management
    - Example: API use and local temporary storage, see [labordynamicsinstitute/alfred_example](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/alfred_example)
    - Notes from live presentation: [scratchpad.txt](day1/scratchpad.txt)
- Readme 
    - [Template README by social science data editors](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html)
    - [Tricky data citations](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html)
- Computing environments
- An example of reproducible document (hands-on)

### Day 2

- Computational empathy in practice: reviewing other's code and how you should think about your own code
- An example of an archive ready workflow, from A (acquisition) to Z (Zenodo) and beyond
- Docker for Stata 

### Day 3

- Discussion/ follow-up to days 1, 2
- Parallel computing: scaling up your analysis, freeing up your time
- Handling of large / confidential data
- Other stuff (to be determined by participants on days 1 and 2)


Requirements
-------------

* Working knowledge of at least one statistical programming language (R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, Julia) - the specific languange is not important.
* An interest in computational social science

People
======

Workshop organizer and lead discussant: Lars Vilhuber (Economist, Data Editor for the American Economic Association). Lars leads a Cornell-based lab that has reviewed and assessed reproducibility of over 1,000 article in the AEA's eight journals.

Additional workshop presenters will be announced at a later stage.
