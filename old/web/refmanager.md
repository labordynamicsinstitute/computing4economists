# Bibliographical stuff
## Citation managers
Cornell Libraries has a [page](https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation) listing a few citation managers:
* [RefWorks](http://www.refworks.cornell.edu/)
* [EndNote](http://www.endnote.com/)
* [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/)
* [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/)

We can add to that

* [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/)

Depending on your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) and writing software (Word, Latex), your choices may vary.
