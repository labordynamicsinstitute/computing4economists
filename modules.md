## Module 1: Day 1 reproducibility

- 1.5 hours
- Develop habits, processes, structure for each project

## Module 2: Useful tools: Why you should learn (and love) the command line

- 30 minutes
- Bash scripting
- Git versioning (or any versioning)
- Then go off and do Carpentries training on either on your own

> [Notes](modules2)

## Intermezzo: Present 15 minutes of own research

- Students present 15 minutes of their research (2nd or 3rd year paper, depending on context)

## Module 3: Writing articles that combine text and code

- 1.5 hours
- Using arbitrary code, LaTeX, Git, and Overleaf
- Using integrated notebooks and what to do when your journal doesn't like Markdown (which is all of them) (Quarto, Jupyter notebooks with Stata)
- Method taught, vs. Lars' preferred method

## Module 4: High-performance computing and why you should care about it

- 1.5 hours, including hands-on
- What is HPC
- When to invest in it
- Where to get it (BioHPC intro)
- What to consider
- Try it out
  - Embarassingly parallel Stata code
  - Easy parallel Julia code
  - High-performance MPI code

## Module 5: Reproducibility, transparency, and data ethics: How and when to share data, and when not to

- 45 minutes
- On your own: [Reproducibility and Ethics/ sharing data](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/crress/#session-2)
- Discussion
- Data here:
  - Collected data (survey, behavioral experiments)
  - Acquired data (from the internets, from commercial providers)

## Module 6: Day N-1 reproducibility

- 1.5 hours
- How to check your project for reproducibility
- Computational empathy
- Environments, even or especially in Stata, and why you should embrace them

## Module 7: Creating an archive, and why that's a good thing

- 45 minutes
- Difference between "sharing" and "publishing" and "preserving"
- Hands-on workflow:
    - create an archive on Zenodo
    - use an archive on Zenodo in your own workflow
    - how to tie it correctly together
 
## Intermezzo: Presenting progress on research

- Students present progress on their research
- Students comment in particular on which parts of the various modules they have used and found useful

## Module 8: Writing a grant proposal

- 45 minutes
- Grant proposal as
  - a 15-page paper
  - with a single accept-reject (or substantial rewrites before every resubmission)
  - with a target audience of initially 1 (the program manager)
- Grant management, and what you need to know
- Connection with RDC applications (around the world)
