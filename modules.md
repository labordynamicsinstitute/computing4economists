## Module 1: Day 1 reproducibility

- 1.5 hours
- Develop habits, processes, structure for each project
- Possible slides: [Day 1 reproducibility](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/day1-tutorial/)

## Module 2: Useful tools: Why you should learn (and love) the command line

- 30 minutes
- Bash scripting
- Git versioning (or any versioning)
- Then go off and do Carpentries training on either on your own
  - [Shell for novices](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
  - [Git for novices](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

> [Notes](module2.html)

## Intermezzo: Present 15 minutes of own research

- Students present 15 minutes of their research (2nd or 3rd year paper, depending on context)

## Module 3: Writing articles that combine text and code

- 1.5 hours
- Using arbitrary code, LaTeX, Git, and Overleaf
- Using integrated notebooks and what to do when your journal doesn't like Markdown (which is all of them) (Quarto, Jupyter notebooks with Stata)
- Method taught, vs. Lars' preferred method
- Examples with caveats - none of these are particularly focused on **reproducible** notebooks and how to integrate with articles that need to be submitted.
  - [Jupyter Notebooks](https://datacarpentry.github.io/python-ecology-lesson/jupyter_notebooks.html) but focuses on Python
  - [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
  - 

## Module 4: High-performance computing and why you should care about it

- 1.5 hours, including hands-on
- What is HPC
- When to invest in it
- Where to get it (BioHPC intro)
- What to consider
- Try it out (prior lessons exist)
  - Embarassingly parallel Stata code
  - Easy parallel Julia code
  - High-performance MPI code

## Module 5: Reproducibility, transparency, and data ethics: How and when to share data, and when not to

- 45 minutes
- On your own: [Reproducibility and Ethics/ sharing data](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/crress/#session-2)
- Discussion
- Data here:
  - Collected data (survey, behavioral experiments)
  - Acquired data (from the internets, from commercial providers)
- Partial discussion of code in the case of confidential data
  - [Presentation](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/reproducibility-confidential/)

## Module 6: Day N-1 reproducibility

- 1.5 hours
- How to check your project for reproducibility
- Computational empathy
- Environments, even or especially in Stata, and why you should embrace them
- Possible presentation: [Self-checking reproducibility](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/presentation/)

## Module 7: Creating an archive, and why that's a good thing

- 45 minutes
- Difference between "sharing" and "publishing" and "preserving"
- Hands-on workflow:
    - create an archive on Zenodo
    - use an archive on Zenodo in your own workflow
    - how to tie it correctly together
- Partial presentations (may no longer work, changes of Zenodo)
  - [2019 version](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replication-tutorial-2019/#/18)
  - [2021 version](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/tutorial-data-sharing-archiving-2021/)
 
## Intermezzo: Presenting progress on research

- Students present progress on their research
- Students comment in particular on which parts of the various modules they have used and found useful

## Module 8: Writing a grant proposal

- 45 minutes
- Grant proposal as
  - a 15-page paper
  - with a single accept-reject (or substantial rewrites before every resubmission)
  - with a target audience of initially 1 (the program manager)
- Grant management, and what you need to know
- (maybe) Connection with RDC applications (around the world)

## Module 9: Writing peer reviews

- 1.5 hrs
- Peer review, what to write, how to write it, style, content
- Graduate topic: peer reviewing papers
- Undergraduate topic: peer reviewing (constructive criticism) of code
- Both: Latent hierarchies in readers of peer reviews (or: how to manage up, or: how to write a criticism when the recipient has 20 years more experience and a Nobel prize)
- Some reading:
  - https://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/5542
  - https://deryugina.com/how-to-be-a-constructive-referee/
  - https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/craft-referee.html (peripheral to coding)
  - https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.31.1.231

## Module 10: Presenting

- 45 min
- Primarily review of elements
- There is a fine line between a great introduction/motivation and a long one that risks losing audienceâ€™s interest. Remember,
  - you want the audience to remember what you have done,
  - then why it is important and
  - only then how in detail you have done it.
