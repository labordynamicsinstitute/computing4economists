## Command line

### How

- [Notes](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replicability-training-presentation/part4.html)

(live)

### Why

- Key for high-performance computing
- Important to understand for multi-software projects (and even for many OS-interactions of higher-level software)
- Easier to document repetitive tasks (and then automate them!)

### Resources

- [Carpentries' "The Unix Shell"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
    - [Some brief examples](documents/hp-basics-edited.pdf)

## Git

### How

- [Notes](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replicability-training-presentation/part4.html)

(live)

### Why

- Git is not Github
  - but Github is really convenient
- better version control
    - [incomplete examples](documents/hp-basics-edited.pdf)

## Text editor vs. IDE

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is primarily a text editor, but can be an IDE

- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is an IDE optimized for R, a bit for Python, but can be a (not so great) text editor
- [Stata] is an IDE, optimized almost uniquely for Stata

Both types (editor and IDE) have their role.

- debugging in IDE
- all other editing in text editor
- see use of command line as well for general-purpose tasks.
