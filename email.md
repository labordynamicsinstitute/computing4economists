# Computational Tools for Social Scientists Workshop

**Date**: 2020/8/24-2020/8/27 _|_ 
**Location**: *Online*  _|_
**Time**: *2:00 - 6:00 p.m.* (some days will end earlier)


The goal of this workshop is to showcase computer-oriented techniques and tools for social science students, from basic command line tools on Linux and Mac to version control to optimization and parallelization techniques for high-performance computing, with reproducible methods training thrown in for good measure. The goal is NOT to teach a full course on SAS, Stata, Matlab, R, Python, MPI, Fortran, etc. - there are other classes for that. We will teach just enough of each programming language to be able to highlight additional techniques. There will be hands-on training on a few systems, such as the new Econ cluster (for economics students) and cloud-based resources. This workshop is designed to open your eyes to the possibilities, scratching the surface, but mostly not diving into any particular depths.

**Who**: Second year Ph.D. and higher, and faculty, in Economics or other social sciences. If you haven't taken the course in the past, or want a refresher, you should participate.

**Tentative syllabus here**: https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/computing4economists/web/. We may modify the actual activities based on where the workshop participants express needs and interest.

Some GRA supervisors are requiring this course, so please check with your GRA supervisor.
